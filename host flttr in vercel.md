To host a Flutter web app (built for Chrome) on Vercel, you need to follow a series of steps. Here's a detailed guide:

### Step 1: Build Your Flutter Web App

First, you need to build your Flutter app for the web.

1. **Ensure Flutter is Set Up for Web**:
   Make sure you have Flutter set up and that your app is ready to run on the web. You can check the available devices with:

   ```bash
   flutter devices
   ```

2. **Build the Web Version**:
   Run the following command in your Flutter project directory to build the web version of your app:

   ```bash
   flutter build web --no-tree-shake-icons

   ```

   This will create a `build/web` folder in your project, which contains the production-ready web assets (HTML, JS, CSS).

### Step 2: Create a Vercel Project

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   If you haven't installed Vercel CLI yet, install it globally via npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**:
   Log in to your Vercel account using the CLI:

   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

   If you don't have an account yet, you'll be prompted to sign up.

3. **Initialize Your Project**:
   Navigate to the root directory of your Flutter project and run the following command to create a new Vercel project:

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

   It will guide you through the process, asking for your project name, team, and other configuration details. You can generally accept the default options.

### Step 3: Configure Vercel for Flutter Web

1. **Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)**:
   You may want to configure Vercel to serve the web build correctly. Create a `vercel.json` file in your project root with the following content:

   ```json
   {
     "builds": [
       {
         "src": "build/web/**",
         "use": "@vercel/static"
       }
     ],
     "routes": [
       {
         "src": "/(.*)",
         "dest": "/build/web/$1"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   This tells Vercel to serve files from the `build/web` directory.

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

Once everything is set up, you're ready to deploy. Run the following command from your project directory:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

This will deploy your app to Vercel. It may take a few moments, and when done, you'll receive a URL where your Flutter web app is hosted.

### Step 5: Update Your App (Optional)

If you make any updates to your Flutter web app, just run the following command to rebuild and redeploy:

```bash
flutter build web
vercel --prod
```

### Additional Notes:

* If you're using custom domains, you can link it in the Vercel dashboard after the deployment.
* Vercel also supports automatic deployments from GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. If you connect your repository, Vercel can automatically build and deploy your app when changes are pushed.

This should get your Flutter web app running on Vercel! If you run into any issues, feel free to let me know.
